Review:
Starting off by looking at the fieldsI see that there are many things that the boomerange needs to know,
such as the delay when it gets removed, whether it can hurt kirby, where it has exploded, starting locations
and direction, which are all pretty standard.  It also seems that it needs a parameter passed in to know
if it can hurt kirby.  The collision code is pretty standard as well.

Comments:
So the code at first glance is easy to understand, however there was one thing that kind of 
confused me, which is the canHurtKirby method.  It took me a while to understand what it meant,
but its basically a getter kind of method, which is pretty normal.  Also the direction was kind of hard 
to understand at first but it seemed you associated directions with numbers.  And there are two cases
where this projectile will be removed which is when it can hurt kirby
or can't hurt kirby, which would be more understandable with comments, but I'm guessing
one is where kirby thrwos the boomerang and where sir kirble throws it.  Overall
very good simple effective implemintation.
